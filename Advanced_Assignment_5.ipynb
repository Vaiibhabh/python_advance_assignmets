    "Ans. Pseudoprivate attributes are also useful in larger frameworks or tools, both to avoid introducing new method names that might inadvertently hide definitions elsewhere in the class tree and to reduce the likelihood of internal methods being replaced by names defined lower in the class tree. If a method is intended for use only within a class that may be mixed into other classes, the double underscore prefix ensures that the method's name will not conflict with other names in the tree, particularly in multiple-inheritance situations.\n",
