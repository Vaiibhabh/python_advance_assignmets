    "Ans. __getattribute__ is used to locate a class attribute. It raises an AttributeError if a class attribute cannot be located. __getattr__ is implemented if __getattribute__ generates an AttributeError; however, both __getattribute__ and __getattr__ must be defined in the same class. __getattr__ returns a default value if no attribute is present. The primary distinction is that __getattr__ is invoked for attributes that do not exist on a class."
