    "Ans. Multiple data items of the same type are represented by arrays using a single name. Arrays allow random access to their elements via the index number. Arrays assign contiguous memory locations to each of their elements. Therefore, there is no possibility of extra memory being allocated for arrays. This prevents memory overflow and memory shortage in arrays."
